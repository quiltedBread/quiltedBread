# Hi, I'm Matt Harper.

I'm a scientist with a passion for web development. I'm interested in genetics, laboratory automation, and new web technologies. Most of my repositories have something to do with genetics, but I also enjoy building sites and applications for small businesses. I'm a perfectionist and believe all software should make things simpler, or at least appear to.
