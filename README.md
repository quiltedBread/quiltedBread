# Hi, I'm Matt Harper.

I'm a scientist with a passion for web development. I'm interested in genetics, laboratory automation, and new web technologies. Most of my repositories have something to do with science, but I also enjoy building sites and applications for small businesses. I'm a perfectionist and believe all software should make things simple, or appear to be.
